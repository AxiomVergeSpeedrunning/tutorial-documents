# The Void

The void is a strange place beyond the bounds of an area's map. Whenever the active character--either Trace or the drone--attempts to touch it, they are immediately set back to their most recent valid position, as if they became fully immersed in a wall. Additionally, certain calculations, such as grapple head and drill collision, will instantly crash the game if they attempt to act on the void. The most immediately accessible void in the game is located below the lowest acid pit in Mission Impossible (the first room of Kur).

# The Warp

Trace and the drone store their positions separately, and the drone's position doesn't update when it's not in use. These properties allow us to give the drone some position in one map, then cause it to regain that same position in a different map. This is used primarily to warp from Mission Impossible to upper Kur for extended launch and E-Kur-Mah entry, although other uses are available, such as warping to the save point by grapple room.
