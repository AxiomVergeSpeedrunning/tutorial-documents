Vision skip is a very special trick. Not often does one skip showcase so many glitches pertaining to one item as efficiently as it does for the grapple. It uses grapple to clip through walls, warp across the map, and clip through floors, one after the other.

# Part 1: Laser Wall Clip

The first step of vision skip, and the step which particularly can skip the "drugged" effect, is the clip through the laser wall in Indi. It is performed by holding aim lock and tapping down while standing (facing left) against the wall, jumping, and then rolling inputs from up to up-right to grapple.

When the aim lock input is held, grapple turns continuously; this forces the game to make assumptions and compromises about the angle you should end up at once it connects with a ceiling. This setup forces the grapple to shoot directly into the corner next to the laser while holding up-right, and the game tries to snap your position to an up-right angle to compensate. This places you most of the way through the wall, breaking the grapple in the process.

# Part 2: Door Grapple

Immediately after clipping through the laser, you come to a door. But not just any door--this door is an area transition. That means it sets your position from the top of an area to the bottom of a different area, resulting in a massive total displacement. However, the grapple head is unaffected by the door, and stays at the top of the area, causing you to be pulled back up to it in the new area and placed very far offscreen.

It is performed by holding aim lock, tapping down, jumping, and shooting grapple. The timing of this trick has the greatest leniency of all 3 parts.

# Part 3: Floor Clip

So where did that put us? Turns out, as long as Vision has not been killed yet, we're now in a prototype version of the large room next to where you would be able to see Elsenova after obtaining Redcoat. Since this room is unfinished, there are a couple changes from the normal version: if you enter the door to the left, the game crashes; and there is a small indentation in the right wall. That's our ticket to get back on screen and finish the skip.

As I have already explained, grapple tries to snap you to an appropriate angle when holding aim lock in the air--if you are not airborne, you will simply remain standing on the ground with the grapple attached, which is uninteresting. This time, we want the grapple to be as long as possible, and to be holding straight up when it connects. The distance between the ceiling we're grappling and the ceiling we want to snap down to is 9 blocks, the furthest distance possible to cover with a grapple clip, so this is going to be tight. Even worse, there is a gap at 7 blocks down which can trap you in place in a way which requires lagging the game while holding left, or simply quitting to title, to escape. If that happens, I believe that indicates you were standing too far to the right when attempting the trick.

The general sequence of inputs is: while holding lock, tap down; then press grapple, jump, up. Jump and up are input very close to each other, but not quite simultaneously. You also must be standing in approximately the right spot, which can be judged be the position of the camera.

When you successfully clip through the floor, the camera will shift to the right. At this point, you can simply walk left to the door and exit the save room just before the Vision fight.
